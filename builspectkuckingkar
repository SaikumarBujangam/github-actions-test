The below is the current workflow file in my Client repository from where the CICD processes begin.

We used to have four branches.

master, release/qa, release/qc and release/prod

# DO NOT MODIFY OR DELETE THIS WORKFLOW!!

name: ADL CICD Initiate Deployment

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master, release/qa, release/qc, release/prod ]
    types: [opened, reopened, edited]
  push:
    branches: [master, release/qa, release/qc, release/prod ]
    paths-ignore:
      - '.version'
      - '.github/**'
      - 'Explore/**'
      - 'README.md'
      - 'CODEOWNERS'
      - '.group'
      
jobs:
  adl-cicd-check-pull-request:
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    uses: AlightEngineering/adl-awsdeploy-cicd/.github/workflows/adl-cicd-check-pull-request.yml@master
    secrets:
      envPAT: ${{ secrets.REPO_PAT }}

  adl-cicd-deploy-phase:
    if: github.event_name == 'push'
    uses: AlightEngineering/adl-awsdeploy-cicd/.github/workflows/adl-cicd-deploy-repo-phase.yml@feature/permissionchange
    secrets: inherit
    with:
      event_repo_name: ${{ github.repository }}
      event_repo_branch: ${{ github.ref_name }}
      
  adl-log-event:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Default
        run: |
          echo ${{ github.event_name }}
		  
Now we are trying to remove the branches and keep only feature branches and master branch and PR can happen only from feature branches to master branch
