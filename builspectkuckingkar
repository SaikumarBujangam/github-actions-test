Informatica currently enables Git branching through Source Control Configurations, allowing check-in and checkout operations to be directed to a configured branch. At present, the limitation is that only a single branch can be set up for the entire organization. Branch merging and conflict resolution are required to be performed outside of Informatica Cloud Integration Hub (IICS), typically in GitHub, due to this limitation. To manage this efficiently, we devised a strategy involving the creation of a centralized repository for Informatica projects, named "adl-informatica-etl." This repository hosts the code for various projects within the "Explore" folder.

When teams perform checkouts in Informatica (using the Development Org ID), the process merges changes into the master branch. This action triggers a pipeline that records the merge's commit ID in an S3 bucket. Subsequently, teams manually initiate the pipeline within their project-specific repositories to deploy changes in the development environment. This approach is effective for development stages. However, it presents challenges as code progresses through higher environment lifecycles, such as release/qa, release/qc, and release/prod. In these stages, code from multiple projects must be advanced together within the Informatica repository, even though teams may only wish to deploy their specific project's code using their repositories' pipelines. Moreover, the existing process does not accommodate hotfixes or rollback deployments effectively.
