Project-Specific Folder Deployment Challenges:

In the centralized "adl-informatica-etl" repository, each team works on its project-specific folder. However, when attempting to advance only their project's code to higher environments (e.g., release/qa, release/qc, release/prod), teams face a critical bottleneck. The process of raising a Pull Request (PR) inadvertently includes changes from other projects due to the shared repository structure. This situation forces teams to consider code changes they do not manage and are not responsible for, leading to an untenable position where approving PRs could inadvertently affect the integrity and stability of the deployment in higher environments.
