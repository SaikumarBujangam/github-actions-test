Contribution in hiring, training and productivity of new resources 

"In the past year, my contributions have focused on enhancing team cohesion and productivity, particularly through informal support and mentorship to our DevOps team. By sharing key resources, offering technical guidance, and fostering a culture of open communication and continuous improvement, I've aimed to bolster the integration and efficiency of our team's operations. My efforts have helped maintain a supportive environment that encourages innovation and adaptability, ensuring our team continues to thrive even without the addition of new hires."
