Hi All,

Just a high-level update – we did some testing in Dev today on the cases-hrxassist beta-test repository.
1.	MD5 checksum feature seems to work fine – its deploying only those files that were changed as part of that GitHub push and other files in the directory remain unchanged.
2.	Auto-deployment also happened fine for the scripts that we edited. This was tested on both current & legacy paths. Only changed components were deployed, as mentioned above. Deployment workflow didn’t take more than a min. to deploy the components in /bin directory so deployment timings also look fine.
3.	Permissions on /config files are still reverting to 775 after a few minutes of deployment – this needs to be checked further and we’ll need to re-test later.

@Saikumar, please feel free to add more details to this in case I am missing anything, I have just tried to provide a high-level view of what we tested today.


best regards,
Utsav Mehta
