Problem Context 

Informatica currently supports Git branching via Source Control Configurations and all the check-in/checkout operations get into the Branch that’s configured. As of now, only one branch can be configured for the entire Org.  Branch merge/conflicts should happen outside IICS (GitHub). Because of this tool restriction, we have initially designed a solution to handle this efficiently by creating a centralized repository for informatica called “adl-informatica-etl” which contains the code for all the different projects in the Explore folder in the repository. So, whenever teams check out the code in the informatica (Development Org ID), it does a merge into the master branch which triggers the pipeline and stores the commit ID of the merge in the S3 bucket. The teams then run the pipeline manually in their project specific repositories to do the deployment in dev and this works fine for Dev, but when the code has to be taken for higher environment lifecycles (release/qa, release/qc and release/prod) the teams has to even take other project code into the higher environments in the informatica repository, although the teams can push only their code into informatica using the pipeline in their project specific repositories. Also, the current process doesn’t support hotfix or rollback deployments.
