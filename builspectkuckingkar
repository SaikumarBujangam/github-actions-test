Subject: Request for Office Location Change to CDC5

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request a change in my designated office location from OTP to CDC5. After careful consideration, I believe that this change would not only significantly benefit my daily commute but also enhance my productivity and work-life balance.

Currently, my commute to OTP involves a journey of approximately 35 kilometers from my accommodation, which presents considerable challenges in terms of travel time and logistics. On the other hand, CDC5 is only 5 kilometers away, offering a more manageable and efficient commute. The proximity of CDC5 to my residence would greatly reduce travel time, allowing me to dedicate more energy and focus to my work responsibilities.

I understand that such requests require careful consideration, and I assure you that my commitment to my role and responsibilities will remain my top priority. I believe that being closer to home will enable me to maintain a healthier balance between my professional and personal life, ultimately contributing to a more productive and engaged work environment.

I am more than willing to discuss this request further at your convenience and provide any additional information you may need. I appreciate your understanding and consideration of my situation, and I look forward to your favorable response.

Thank you very much for your time and attention to this matter.

Best regards,

[Your Name]  
[Your Position]
