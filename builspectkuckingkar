Enhancements to CI/CD Process: Introduction of Hotfix Deployment

Our current CI/CD process lacks direct support for hotfix deployments. To address this, we're introducing a new hotfix feature that enables developers to deploy hotfixes directly to production, streamlining urgent updates.

Process Overview:

Hotfix Branch Creation:

Developers begin by cloning the master branch from the centralized repository (adl-informatica-etl) to their local machines.
A new branch, named hotfix/<name>, is created from the master branch for the specific hotfix.
Development and Commit:

Developers make necessary changes in their local hotfix branch.
Changes are committed to the local hotfix branch.
Deployment Trigger:

Once changes are pushed to the remote repository under the new hotfix/<name> branch, it triggers a deployment process.
Deployment to production requires lead approval, akin to the existing process where merging a PR from release/qc to release/prod captures the commit ID in the Prod bucket.
With the hotfix, a similar backend code addition ensures that committing to the hotfix branch stores the commit ID in the Prod bucket. Teams then execute a manual workflow, specifying project names in project-specific repositories, to deploy in the Production environment in Informatica.
Finalization:

After resolving the issue, the hotfix branch is merged back into the master branch through a pull request.
This merge triggers deployments to the lower lifecycles (QA, QC, and Prod), necessitating teams to navigate to project-specific repositories. Manual workflows are then executed in the respective environments to integrate the updated code.
This streamlined hotfix process ensures rapid deployment of critical updates directly to production, while maintaining alignment with our standard deployment practices for thoroughness and security.
