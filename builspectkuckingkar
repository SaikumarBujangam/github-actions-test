I have a case where I have to create the below two repos using terraform

Ecr repo
code commit repo

I have three cases. I need to create the repos under organisation level, project 1 level and project 2 level.

People who are part of project 1 should access only project 1 repos and in the same way people who are part of project 2 should access only project 2 repo. But people who are from both projects should access organisation level repos.

help me in creating the terraform for the same.
