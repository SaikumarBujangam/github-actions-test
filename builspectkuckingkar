Well done Sai! 

As a curiosity can you please talk about how this certification is going to help you in your day-to-day work or strategically. I would like to get objective inputs from you and then talk to Alight instead of just saying that we have folks who have completed certification. Makes sense?

Thanks & Regards,
Deependra Kumar
