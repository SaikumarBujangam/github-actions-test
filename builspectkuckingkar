To obtain the details required for the "Resource" field in the policy, you can follow these steps:

1. Log into the AWS Management Console.
2. Open the CloudWatch service.
3. In the navigation pane, select "Logs" to view the list of log groups.
4. Locate and select the specific log group that you want to grant access to.
5. In the log group details, you can find the "ARN" (Amazon Resource Name) associated with the log group.

The log group ARN will have the following format:

```
arn:aws:logs:<region>:<account-id>:log-group:<log-group-name>
```

- Replace `<region>` with the appropriate AWS region where the log group is located.
- Replace `<account-id>` with your AWS account ID.
- Replace `<log-group-name>` with the name of the specific log group.

By gathering this information, you can construct the correct ARN for the log group and use it in the "Resource" field of the policy.

Please note that you will need sufficient permissions and access to CloudWatch Logs to view and retrieve the log group details.
