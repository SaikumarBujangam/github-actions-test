1. Single Branch Configuration Limitation

Informatica supports Git branching through Source Control Configurations but restricts the configuration to a single branch for the entire organization. This limitation complicates branching strategies and requires external tools for branch merging and conflict resolution, typically outside of IICS (e.g., in GitHub).
2. Centralized Repository for Project Management

To manage the single branch limitation, a centralized repository named "adl-informatica-etl" was created. This repository houses the code for all projects in the "Explore" folder, intending to streamline check-in/check-out operations and merge processes.
3. Development Environment Deployment Workflow

During development, teams merge changes into the master branch, which triggers a pipeline that logs the merge's commit ID in an S3 bucket. Teams then manually trigger project-specific pipelines to deploy to the development environment. This workflow, while functional for development stages, introduces complexity and manual steps.
4. Challenges with Higher Environment Lifecycles

The centralized repository approach poses significant challenges for deploying code through higher environment lifecycles (e.g., release/qa, release/qc, release/prod). Since the repository contains multiple projects' code, moving code to these environments necessitates including unrelated project code, complicating the deployment process.
5. Lack of Support for Hotfixes and Rollbacks

The current process does not effectively support the deployment of hotfixes or the execution of rollback deployments. This limitation can impact the organization's ability to quickly address production issues or revert changes in case of errors or unforeseen problems.
