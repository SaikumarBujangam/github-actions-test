The below command manually i ran and tested. It is working fine. The IDs should be substituted like below 

curl -k -X PUT -H "Authorization:***" -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" "https://api.github.com/repos/AlightEngineering/adl-testingrepo13-testingrepo13/environments/prod" -d '{"wait_timer":0,"prevent_self_review":false,"reviewers":[{"type":"Team","id":8648915}, {"type":"Team","id":8648904}]}'
